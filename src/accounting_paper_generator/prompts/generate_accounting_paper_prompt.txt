You are an expert accountant tasked with generating an accounting paper based on the provided information. Follow these instructions carefully to complete the task:

1. Review the following template that will serve as the structure for your accounting paper:

<accounting_paper_template>
{{accounting_paper_template}}
</accounting_paper_template>

2. Take note of these specific instructions for completing the accounting paper:

<generate_accounting_paper_instructions>
{{generate_accounting_paper_instructions}}
</generate_accounting_paper_instructions>

3. Familiarize yourself with the product description:

<fintech_product_description>
{{fintech_product_description}}
</fintech_product_description>

4. Review the events that need to be accounted for:

<events>
{{events}}
</events>

4.1 for each event:

Interpret the event: Extract the financial actions and determine the correct debits, credits, and any applicable fees.
Generate journal entries: Create appropriate accounting entries based on the described financial actions using standard accounting rules (e.g., debiting assets for increases, crediting liabilities for increases).
Reference relevant accounting regulations: Based on the nature of the event, identify the applicable accounting regulation (e.g., IFRS, GAAP) and specific paragraph that justifies the decision.
Document the decision process: Alongside the journal entries, include a rationale explaining how the accounting standards apply to the event.
Present the journal entries in a tabular format: Ensure the output is formatted as a table for readability, like the example provided.
For each event, the input will include:

event_name: A description of the financial event (e.g., "Intra-Branch Transfer Execution").
trigger: The action or condition that initiates the event (e.g., "Sender confirms transfer after authentication").
financial_impact: A detailed description of the financial actions that need to be processed (e.g., "1) Transfer amount debited from sender's account. 2) Same amount credited to recipient's account. 3) Transfer fee deducted from sender's account.").


Output Format:
Journal Entries: Presented in the following tabular format:
Date	Account	Debit	Credit
YYYY-MM-DD	Account Name (type: Asset/Liability/Income)	Amount	Amount
Regulation and Paragraph: The relevant accounting regulation and paragraph (e.g., IFRS 15, Paragraph 31) that was used to justify the treatment of the event.

Rationale: A brief explanation of how the event relates to the identified accounting regulation.

<example input>
{
  "event_name": "Intra-Branch Transfer Execution",
  "trigger": "Sender confirms transfer after authentication",
  "financial_impact": "1) Transfer amount (e.g., $1000) debited from sender's account. 2) Same amount ($1000) credited to recipient's account. 3) Any applicable transfer fee (e.g., $2) deducted from sender's account."
}
</example input>

<expected output>
Accounting Treatment:

Date	Account	Debit	Credit
2024-01-20	Demand Deposits (2010) (Asset)	1,000	
2024-01-20	Demand Deposits (2010) (Asset)		1,000
2024-01-20	Transfer Fees (Expense)	2	
2024-01-20	Digital Banking Service Fees (4140) (Income)		2
Regulation and Paragraph:
IFRS 15, Paragraph 31: Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a service to the customer.

Rationale:
The transfer fee represents a service performed immediately. According to IFRS 15, revenue can be recognized at the point when the customer receives and consumes the benefit of the service (e.g., the transfer processing). The transfer amount itself is an asset movement and does not impact revenue.
