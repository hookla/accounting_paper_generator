</product_description>

Provide a list of core financial events for this product. Each event must directly cause monetary transactions or immediate changes in financial obligations. Adhere to these principles:

<principles>
1. Direct Financial Impact: 
   Events must result in immediate money movement or changes in financial obligations.

2. Complete Transactions: 
   Capture the full scope of each financial transaction, including all associated actions (e.g., principal movements, fee applications) in a single event.

3. Distinct Events: 
   Each event should represent a unique, significant financial action. Avoid listing steps of a larger process as separate events.

4. Measurable Outcomes: 
   Every event must have quantifiable financial consequences.

5. Immediate Effects: 
   Focus solely on events with instant financial impact. Exclude potential future impacts or administrative changes without immediate financial consequences.
</principles>

<key_exclusions>
- Administrative or policy changes without direct financial impact
- Purely informational or preparatory actions
- Events that only enable future transactions without immediate financial effects
</key_exclusions>
