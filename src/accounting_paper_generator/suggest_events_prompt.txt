Consider this financial product:

</product description>

For this product, provide a list of events that directly cause financial transactions or immediate changes in financial obligations. Use the following guidelines:

1. Direct Financial Impact:
   Only include events that result in immediate money movement, changes in account balances, or alterations to financial obligations. The event must have a direct, measurable financial consequence.

2. Complete Transactions:
   Each event should capture the full scope of a financial transaction, including any associated fees, charges, or immediate follow-on actions. Avoid separating closely related financial actions into multiple events.

3. Triggering Actions:
   Events can be triggered by user actions, system processes, or external factors, but must always lead to a direct financial outcome.

4. Immediate vs. Potential:
   Focus on events with immediate financial impact. Exclude events that only create the potential for future financial transactions without causing immediate changes.

5. Measurable Outcomes:
   Each event should result in a quantifiable financial change, such as specific amounts being transferred, added, or deducted.

Important Guidelines:
- Exclude administrative or policy changes that don't immediately affect financial states (e.g., credit limit increases without immediate borrowing).
- Omit events that are purely informational or preparatory unless they directly trigger a financial transaction.
- Ensure each event represents a distinct, complete financial action or consequence, not a step in a larger process.
- For recurring processes, only include the instance that causes the actual financial change.
- Combine related financial actions (e.g., principal movement and fee application) into a single event when they occur simultaneously as part of the same process.
