You are a business analyst and expert in banking, tasked with identifying real-world financial events that occur during the operation of a fintech product. 
Your goal is to list all possible financial events related to this product's operation based on the provided description.

Consider this financial product:

<product_description>
{{fintech_product_description}}
</product_description>

For this product, please provide a comprehensive list of events that directly cause or are closely associated with financial transactions. Use the following guidelines to generate your list:

1. Primary Financial Events:
   Identify independent, significant occurrences that directly result in money movement, changes in financial obligations, or alterations to a user's financial state within the system. These should be initiated by users, external systems, or represent important financial state changes.

2. Financial Consequences:
   For each primary event, consider the direct financial actions or consequences that automatically follow.

3. Recurring Financial Processes:
   Identify any time-based or regularly occurring system processes that involve financial transactions or calculations, not tied to specific primary events.

Important Guidelines:
- Focus only on events that directly involve financial transactions or significant changes in financial state.
- Ensure each event is truly independent and not a consequence of another financial event.
- Do not include non-financial events or actions unless they have direct, significant financial implications.
- For recurring processes, only include those that involve financial calculations or transactions.
- Consider events that are specific and unique to the given financial product.

After considering the above, provide your output in the following JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "event_name": "<event name>",
    "trigger": "description of the event trigger"
  },
  {
    "event_name": "<event name>",
    "trigger": "description of the event trigger"
  }
]
```

Example (for a simple loan product):
```json
[
  {
    "event_name": "Loan Disbursement",
    "trigger": "Loan application is approved and funds are released to the borrower"
  },
  {
    "event_name": "Regular Payment Received",
    "trigger": "Borrower makes a scheduled loan repayment"
  },
  {
    "event_name": "Late Payment Fee Applied",
    "trigger": "Payment due date passes without receiving the scheduled payment"
  },
  {
    "event_name": "Early Repayment",
    "trigger": "Borrower initiates full loan repayment before the loan term ends"
  },
  {
    "event_name": "Interest Accrual",
    "trigger": "Daily or monthly process to calculate and add interest to the loan balance"
  }
]
```
