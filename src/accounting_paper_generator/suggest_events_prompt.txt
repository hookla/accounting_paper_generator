You are a business analyst and expert in banking, tasked with identifying real-world financial events that occur during the operation of a fintech product. Your goal is to list all possible financial events related to this product's operation based on the provided description.

Here is the fintech product description:

A financial event is an occurrence that results in the transfer or movement of money in the real world. Each event should represent a specific root business event - something that has happened. An event can cause multiple movements of money.  If several things happen at the same time then they are 1 event.

Guidelines for generating events:
1. Focus only on events that involve actual money transfers or financial impacts in the real world.
2. Consider all aspects of the product's operation, including user transactions, fees, interest, and processes that affect account balances.
3. Include events related to user actions, system processes, and external interactions that have financial implications.
4. Think about events that might occur at different stages: account opening, regular usage, exceptional circumstances, and account closure.
5. Be comprehensive, but ensure each event is distinct and relevant to the described product.
6. Emphasize real-world actions and consequences rather than internal accounting processes.
7. Do not include non-financial events such as user sign-ups or account creations unless they directly involve a monetary transaction.
8. Remember money can not be created only moved.

Here is an example of a good event:
<good_event_example>
Customer A transfers 100 to customer B and pays a fee
</good_event_example>

Here is an example of a bad event:
<bad_event_example>
Event 1: 100 deducted from customer A
Event 2: 100 added to customer B
</bad_event_example>

This is one event, not two events, because money can only be moved, not created. If event 2 happened and not event 1, then money would have been created.

Format your output as follows:
Event Name : Trigger

Each event should be separated by a blank line. The Event Name should describe what actually happened in the real world. The Trigger should explain what caused the event to occur.

Here are two examples of well-formatted events:

<formatting_example>
User Cash Deposit : User visits a partner ATM and deposits cash

Merchant Payment : User makes a purchase using their linked debit card
</formatting_example>

Separate events into Happy Path and Exception Path.

Begin generating the list of financial events now. Do not include any introduction or summary; start directly with the first event. Ensure that each event involves an actual monetary transaction or movement of funds. Use the following structure:

<happy_path>
[List happy path events here]
</happy_path>

<exception_path>
[List exception path events here]
</exception_path>
