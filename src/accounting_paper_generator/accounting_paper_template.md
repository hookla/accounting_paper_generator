### 4.1 Event: User Payment Installment

Description: User selects the product option for a purchase of 1,000 and agrees to pay in 4 installments of 250 each. The first installment is due immediately as a down payment.

Accounting Treatment:

| Date | Account | Debit | Credit |
|------|---------|-----------|------------|

| 2024-01-15 | **Cash (10000)** *(Asset)* | | 250 |

Rationale: The full purchase amount of 1,000 is recorded as a receivable. 750 is recognized as unearned revenue to reflect the future obligation to provide the product/service over the next three installments. The down payment of 250 is recorded as cash received.
